# Open directions to explore
The following provides an overview of directions of development that should be further explored to boost query answer accuracy and reliability and understand more about the nature and scope of the problem.
Quantifying the problem of unreliable and incorrect query answers and exploring which scenarios and model classes are affected to which extent goes hand in hand with developing targeted solutions.

## Provide tabular data in json format (Parser)

## Performance with Latex vs. Markdown (Parser + Eval)

## Evaluate accuracies of different models (Eval)

## Improve prompt + CoT mechanism (Eval + Prompts)
